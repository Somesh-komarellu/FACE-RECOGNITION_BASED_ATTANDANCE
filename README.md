# FACE-RECOGNITION_BASED_ATTANDANCE
Simple and easy code to implement face recognition based attendance system
This project is a Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition technology to mark the attendance of individuals. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces, and compares them with a pre-trained dataset of authorized personnel. If a match is found, the system records the individual's attendance along with the timestamp.

Features:
-Face Detection and Recognition: Uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces.
-Real-Time Attendance Logging: Automatically logs attendance in a CSV file with the individual's name and time of recognition.
-User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for real-time face recognition.
-Scalable and Extendable: Can be easily extended to support larger datasets and more advanced recognition features.
Requirements:
-Python 3.x
-OpenCV
-face_recognition
-NumPy
-Pandas

create a folder and name it as Students. Upload few images of the users. Now make changes in the code at the lines 11 to 24. Open the entire folder with images in vs code and run the program.
